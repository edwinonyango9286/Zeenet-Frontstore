              <h3 className="fw-bold">5. Your Privacy Rights</h3>
              <p>
                In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have
                certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may
                include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of
                your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or
                erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal
                information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In
                certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to
                the processing of your personal information. To make such a
                request, please use the contact details provided below. We will
                consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable
                data protection laws.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we are relying on your consent to process your personal
                information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any
                time. Please note however that this will not affect the
                lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it
                affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
                reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
